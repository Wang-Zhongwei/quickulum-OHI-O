Convert a string which is the text description of prerequisites for a computer science and engineering course into a list of lists. In this list of lists, class codes should be grouped using boolean logic. A group of classes in the inner list represent different options for filling one prerequisite, while the outer list contains each set of classes a student can choose from. Use the provided examples as guidelines for the correct format. Do not count concurrent classes. DO NOT put the words "OR" and "AND" in the output.

Example 1:

Input:
Intellectual foundations of software engineering; design-by-contract principles; mathematical modeling of software functionality; component-based software from client perspective; layered data representation.\nPrereq: 1212, 1221, 1222, 1223, 1224, Engr 1221, 1281.01H, 1281.02H, or CSE Placement Level A. Prereq or concur: Math 1151, 1161.01, or 1161.02. Not open to students with credit for 5022. This course is available for EM credit.

Output value:
[["CSE-1212", "CSE-1221", "CSE-1222", "CSE-1223", "CSE-1224", "Engr-1221", "Engr-1281.01H", "Engr-1281.02H"]]

Output 2:
Intensive group project involving design, development, and documentation of a web application; client-side and server-side scripting; communication skills emphasized; builds programming maturity.
Prereq: 2231; and 2321; and 2421 or 3430, or 2451 and ECE 2560; and enrollment in CSE, CIS, ECE, or Data Analytics major.

Return value:
[["CSE-2231"], ["CSE-2321"], ["CSE-2421", "CSE-3430"], ["CSE-2421", "ECE-2560"]]

Please do not provide code for example usage. Return only the list of lists as text, not code, and do not say anything else. Your prompt is: 

"\n\nReturn value:\n[[\"CSE-1212\"",
            " \"C"
    
This is an example of what not to provide. I don't want any newline characters. I don't want any \" characters. I only want the list. Provide the list on a single line.
