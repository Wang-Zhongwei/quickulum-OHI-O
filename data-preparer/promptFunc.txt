Write a python function that converts one string parameter which is the text description of prerequisites for a computer science and engineering course, and converts it into a list of lists. The output should be a list of lists of prerequisites with their respective course codes based on how they are grouped. This means that if one of multiple courses can be selected for a particular requirement, they are in one inner list. Use the provided examples as guidelines for the correct format. A list of lists should be returned. Name this function parse_prerequisites. Do not count concurrent classes. The words OR and AND are not class prefixes, and therefore should not be in the output at all. I should not see something like "OR-2342" or "AND-3321"

Example 1:

Input:
Intellectual foundations of software engineering; design-by-contract principles; mathematical modeling of software functionality; component-based software from client perspective; layered data representation.\nPrereq: 1212, 1221, 1222, 1223, 1224, Engr 1221, 1281.01H, 1281.02H, or CSE Placement Level A. Prereq or concur: Math 1151, 1161.01, or 1161.02. Not open to students with credit for 5022. This course is available for EM credit.

Return value:
[["CSE-1212", "CSE-1221", "CSE-1222", "CSE-1223", "CSE-1224", "Engr-1221", "Engr-1281.01H", "Engr-1281.02H"]]

Example 2:
Intensive group project involving design, development, and documentation of a web application; client-side and server-side scripting; communication skills emphasized; builds programming maturity.
Prereq: 2231; and 2321; and 2421 or 3430, or 2451 and ECE 2560; and enrollment in CSE, CIS, ECE, or Data Analytics major.

Return value:
[["CSE-2231"], ["CSE-2321"], ["CSE-2421", "CSE-3430"], ["CSE-2421", "ECE-2560"]]

Please do not provide code for example usage.
